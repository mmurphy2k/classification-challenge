## 1. **Program Description**

This program will look at data from an Internet Service Provider (ISP) and the purpose is to improve the email filtering system for its customers. The dataset contains information about emails, with two possible classifications: spam and not spam. The ISP wants to take this dataset and develop a supervised machine learning (ML) model that will accurately detect spam emails so it can filter them out of its customers' inboxes.

The program will be creating two classification models to fit the provided data, and evaluate which model is more accurate at detecting spam. The models created will be using a logistic regression model and a random forest model.
